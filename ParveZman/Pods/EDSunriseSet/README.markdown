EDSunriseSet
---------------
Objective-C class to calculate Sunrise, Sunset, and Twilight times based on the user's current location and time zone.

EDSunriseSet is an Objective-C wrapper for the C languages routines created by [Paul Schlyter].
Calculation is done entirely by the C-code routines. EDSunrisetSet bridges those calculations to common cocoa classes like NSDate and NSTimeZone.

Features
---------------
  - Calculates Sunrise and Sunset times
  - Calculates Civil, Nautical, and Astronomical twilight  
  - Times are calculated based on the provided timezone, latitute, and longitude

Documentation
---------------
To get information about the sunrise, sunset, and twilight use the method below.

    +(EDSunriseSet *)sunrisesetWithTimezone:(NSTimeZone *)timezone latitude:(double)lat longitude:(double)longt
    
This method returns an `EDSunriseSet` object which can be used to access the following `NSDateComponents` each containing a date, hour, minute, and second:

  - The local sunrise time, `localSunrise`  
  - The local sunset time, `localSunset`  
  - The time when civil twilight (when the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon) begins and ends, `localCivilTwilightStart` and `localCivilTwilightEnd`  
  - The time when nautical twilight (when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon) begins and ends, `localNauticalCivilTwilightStart` and `localNauticalCivilTwilightEnd`  
  - The time when astronomical twilight (when the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon) begins and ends, `localAstronomicalTwilightStart` and `localAstronomicalTwilightEnd`

You may also access `NSDate` proprties on `EDSunriseSet` which give a read-only value of the date for the specified property. These properties include `sunrise` and `sunset` among others.
